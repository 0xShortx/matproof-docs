## What is Matproof?

Matproof automates compliance programs for EU-regulated companies — covering frameworks like **DORA**, **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2**, **NIS2**, **GDPR**, and **CSRD**.

Instead of managing compliance in spreadsheets and shared drives, Matproof gives you:

- **AI-generated policies** that map directly to your frameworks
- **Automated evidence collection** from your existing tools
- **Continuous monitoring** with real-time control status
- **Vendor risk management** with built-in Art. 28 register
- **CSRD supply chain module** for ESG data collection and ESRS reporting
