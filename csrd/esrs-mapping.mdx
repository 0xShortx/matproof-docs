## What is ESRS mapping?

The **ESRS mapping view** shows you a complete picture of your CSRD reporting progress — which data points you've collected, which are missing, and what's needed to fill the gaps.

## Navigating the mapping view

Go to **CSRD → ESRS Mapping** to see the full compliance matrix.

Each row represents an **ESRS data point** (a specific metric or disclosure). Columns show:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Standard | Which ESRS standard (E1, E2, S2, etc.) |
| Data point | The specific disclosure requirement |
| Material | Whether this applies to you (from your DMA) |
| Status | Collected / Partial / Missing |
| Source | Where the data came from |
| Value | The actual data point value |

## Filtering

Filter by:
- **Standard** — view only E1, only S2, etc.
- **Status** — see only missing data points
- **Material** — hide non-material topics
- **Mandatory vs. voluntary** — focus on must-have disclosures first

## Data point statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Collected | Data available and validated |
| ⚠️ Partial | Some data collected, not complete |
| ❌ Missing | Required data not yet collected |
| ➖ Not material | Excluded from your report (per DMA) |
| 🔄 Pending | Awaiting supplier response |

## Exporting for your report

Once you've collected sufficient data, export your ESRS data in:

- **Excel** — pre-formatted ESRS disclosure table
- **JSON** — for integration with your existing reporting tool
- **PDF** — human-readable summary

The export includes:
- Quantitative disclosures (numbers, percentages, emissions)
- Qualitative disclosures (policy descriptions, governance info)
- Data quality notes (calculation method, estimation flags)
- Sources and assumptions

## Common gaps

The most commonly missing data points for first-time reporters:

1. **Scope 3 Category 1** (purchased goods) — needs supplier activity data
2. **ESRS S2** (value chain workers) — needs supplier labour practice questionnaire
3. **ESRS E2** (pollution) — needs hazardous substance data from suppliers
4. **IRO documentation** — needs completed DMA with documented IROs
5. **Policies** — needs written sustainability policies per material topic

Matproof highlights your top 5 gaps and suggests how to fill them.
