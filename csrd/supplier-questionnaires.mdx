## Overview

Matproof sends ESRS-aligned questionnaires to your suppliers and collects the responses automatically. Suppliers respond via a **simple web portal** — they don't need a Matproof account.

## Setting up supplier questionnaires

### 1. Import your supplier list

Go to **CSRD → Suppliers → Import**.

Upload a CSV with columns:
```
company_name, contact_email, contact_name, spend_category, country, tier
```

Or add suppliers manually one by one.

### 2. Categorize suppliers

After import, categorize suppliers by:
- **Tier** (Tier 1 = direct, Tier 2 = indirect)
- **Spend category** (e.g., raw materials, logistics, IT services)
- **Risk level** (high, medium, low) — Matproof pre-fills based on country and sector

This determines which questionnaire template is sent.

### 3. Select questionnaire templates

Matproof includes pre-built templates mapped to ESRS:

| Template | Covers |
|----------|--------|
| Standard ESRS | All material ESRS topics, general |
| Scope 3 emissions (E1) | GHG data, energy consumption |
| Labour practices (S2) | Working conditions, wages, safety |
| Business conduct (G1) | Anti-corruption, ethics |
| Full ESRS pack | All of the above combined |

You can also create custom templates in the questionnaire builder.

### 4. Send questionnaires

Select suppliers and click **Send questionnaire**. Matproof:

1. Generates a unique secure link for each supplier
2. Sends the invitation email from your domain (or matproof.com)
3. Tracks open and completion rates
4. Sends automated reminders (configurable: 7, 14, 21 days)

### 5. Monitor responses

Track response status in the **Response Dashboard**:
- Not opened
- In progress
- Submitted
- Validated ✓

Matproof automatically validates submitted data for:
- Required fields completion
- Data format (e.g., emissions in tCO2e)
- Out-of-range values (flags unusual numbers for review)

## Supplier experience

Suppliers receive an email with a link to a **branded questionnaire portal**. They can:
- Complete the form in their own language (EN, DE, FR, ES, IT, NL)
- Save progress and return later
- Upload supporting documents
- Ask clarifying questions via the portal

No account creation or software installation required.

## Data validation and follow-up

After submission, you can:
- **Approve** the response as-is
- **Request clarification** — sends the supplier an email with specific questions
- **Reject** and ask for resubmission

All communication is tracked in the audit log.

## Export and reporting

Collected data feeds directly into:
- Scope 3 calculations (for E1 data)
- ESRS data point mapping
- Your CSRD report export

You can also export raw supplier responses as CSV or Excel for external reporting tools.
