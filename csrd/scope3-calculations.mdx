## What is Scope 3?

Scope 3 emissions are **indirect GHG emissions** that occur in a company's value chain — both upstream (suppliers) and downstream (customers, product use, end-of-life).

Under **ESRS E1-6**, CSRD reporters must disclose Scope 3 emissions across all relevant GHG Protocol categories.

## The 15 Scope 3 categories

| Category | Type | Typical data source |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| 1. Purchased goods & services | Upstream | Supplier spend + emission factors |
| 2. Capital goods | Upstream | Asset purchases |
| 3. Fuel & energy-related | Upstream | Energy supplier data |
| 4. Upstream transportation | Upstream | Logistics provider data |
| 5. Waste generated in operations | Upstream | Waste handler data |
| 6. Business travel | Upstream | HR / travel booking |
| 7. Employee commuting | Upstream | Employee survey |
| 8. Upstream leased assets | Upstream | Lease agreements |
| 9. Downstream transportation | Downstream | Customer delivery data |
| 10. Processing of sold products | Downstream | Customer data |
| 11. Use of sold products | Downstream | Product performance data |
| 12. End-of-life treatment | Downstream | Industry averages |
| 13. Downstream leased assets | Downstream | Lease data |
| 14. Franchises | Downstream | Franchisee data |
| 15. Investments | Downstream | Financial data |

## Calculation methods in Matproof

Matproof supports the three GHG Protocol calculation methods:

### Spend-based method
Uses supplier spend × sector-specific emission factors.
- **Best for:** First-year reporting, when supplier data is unavailable
- **Data needed:** Spend by category, country
- **Emission factors:** Exiobase + DEFRA databases (updated annually)

### Activity-based method
Uses physical activity data × emission factors.
- **Best for:** High-spend categories where accuracy matters
- **Data needed:** Quantities (kg, km, kWh, etc.) from suppliers
- **More accurate** than spend-based

### Supplier-specific method
Uses actual emissions data reported by suppliers.
- **Best for:** Key suppliers with robust carbon accounting
- **Data needed:** Supplier's verified Scope 1 + 2 emissions, allocated to your share
- **Most accurate** — preferred by auditors

## Setting up Scope 3 in Matproof

1. **Go to CSRD → Scope 3**
2. **Select which categories are material** (based on your DMA results)
3. **Choose calculation method per category**
4. **Map your supplier data** — either from questionnaire responses or manual input
5. **Review calculations** — Matproof shows the math and data sources
6. **Export** — results mapped to ESRS E1-6 disclosure requirements

## Collecting data from suppliers

The supplier questionnaire includes Scope 3 data request fields:

- For **spend-based**: Matproof uses your procurement data automatically
- For **activity-based**: Questionnaire asks for quantities (e.g., "How many tonnes of goods did you deliver to us?")
- For **supplier-specific**: Questionnaire asks for their verified Scope 1+2 emissions and revenue attribution

## Emission factors

Matproof uses the following emission factor databases:
- **Exiobase** — multi-regional input-output tables (spend-based)
- **DEFRA** — UK government emission factors (activity-based)
- **ecoinvent** — lifecycle assessment database (product-level)
- **IPCC AR6** — global warming potentials

Databases are updated annually. You can see which version was used in your calculation audit trail.

<Note>
  ESRS E1-6 requires reporting Scope 3 emissions in **CO2 equivalent (CO2e)**, covering all 6 GHGs from the Kyoto Protocol: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6.
