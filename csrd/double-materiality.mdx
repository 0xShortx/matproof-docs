## What is double materiality?

CSRD requires a **double materiality assessment (DMA)** — the process of identifying which sustainability topics are material from two perspectives:

1. **Impact materiality** — How does your company affect people and the environment? (e.g., your Scope 1/2/3 emissions, labor practices in your supply chain)
2. **Financial materiality** — How do sustainability topics affect your company's financial performance? (e.g., climate risks to your assets, regulatory costs)

A topic is material if it meets either threshold — you only need to report on material topics.

## Running a DMA in Matproof

### Step 1: Stakeholder input

Navigate to **CSRD → Double Materiality → Stakeholder Survey**.

Invite internal and external stakeholders to rate sustainability topics by:
- Severity of impact (scale, scope, irremediability)
- Likelihood of occurrence
- Financial significance

Matproof sends a survey link and aggregates responses automatically.

### Step 2: IRO identification

**IROs** = Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities.

For each ESRS topic, Matproof helps you identify and document:
- **Impacts** — actual or potential effects on people/environment
- **Risks** — sustainability-related financial risks
- **Opportunities** — positive financial effects from sustainability actions

Use the IRO matrix in the platform to rate severity and likelihood.

### Step 3: Materiality scoring

Matproof calculates a materiality score for each topic based on:

```
Impact materiality = Severity × Likelihood
Financial materiality = Magnitude × Likelihood × Time horizon
```

Topics scoring above your threshold are marked **material**.

### Step 4: Materiality statement

Once complete, export your **materiality statement** — a required disclosure for CSRD reporters explaining your assessment process and conclusions.

## Which ESRS topics to assess

You must assess all ESRS topics:

| Topic | Standard |
|-------|----------|
| Climate change | E1 |
| Pollution | E2 |
| Water and marine resources | E3 |
| Biodiversity and ecosystems | E4 |
| Resource use and circular economy | E5 |
| Own workforce | S1 |
| Workers in value chain | S2 |
| Affected communities | S3 |
| Consumers and end-users | S4 |
| Business conduct | G1 |

## Tips

<Tip>
  For your first DMA, focus on getting stakeholder input from at least 3-5 internal functions (finance, operations, procurement, legal) plus 2-3 external stakeholders (major customers, suppliers, or NGOs).
</Tip>

<Warning>
  The DMA must be reviewed annually. Material topics can change as your business and external environment evolve.
