## What is the CSRD module?

The **CSRD supply chain module** helps companies subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) collect the ESG data they need from their supplier base.

Under CSRD, large companies must report on sustainability impacts across their **entire value chain** — including upstream suppliers. This means requesting specific data from potentially hundreds of vendors.

Matproof automates this process end-to-end.

## Who needs this?

You need the CSRD module if:

- Your company is subject to CSRD reporting (>500 employees, or large EU-listed company)
- You need Scope 3 emissions data from suppliers (ESRS E1-6)
- You're preparing a **double materiality assessment** (required for all CSRD reporters)
- You're a supplier receiving ESG questionnaires from corporate customers

<Note>
  **Not sure if you're in scope?** Check our [CSRD scope guide](/csrd/reporting) or use the CSRD readiness checker in the platform.
