## Getting your API key

1. Log in to [app.matproof.com](https://app.matproof.com)
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
3. Click **Create API key**
4. Copy and store your key securely — it won't be shown again

## Using your API key

Pass your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.matproof.com/v1/vendors \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## API key scopes

When creating an API key, select the required scopes:

| Scope | Access |
|-------|--------|
| `read:vendors` | List and read vendor data |
| `write:vendors` | Create and update vendors |
| `read:evidence` | Read evidence files |
| `write:evidence` | Upload evidence |
| `read:controls` | Read control status |
| `write:controls` | Update control status |
| `read:risks` | Read risk register |
| `write:risks` | Create and update risks |
| `read:csrd` | Read CSRD/ESG data |
| `write:csrd` | Submit ESG data |

## Security best practices

- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Use the minimum required scopes
- Rotate keys regularly
- Delete keys you're no longer using
- Use separate keys for different applications

## Error responses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `403 Forbidden` | Valid key but insufficient scope |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded |
