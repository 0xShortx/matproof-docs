## Frameworks

A **framework** is a compliance standard or regulation (e.g., DORA, ISO 27001, CSRD). Each framework has a set of **requirements** broken into **controls**.

Matproof maps controls across frameworks automatically — so evidence you collect for ISO 27001 often satisfies overlapping DORA requirements.

## Controls

A **control** is a specific requirement within a framework. For example:

- "Implement multi-factor authentication for all user accounts" (ISO 27001 A.9.4)
- "Maintain a register of all ICT third-party service providers" (DORA Art. 28)

Controls have a **status**:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Met | Evidence collected and approved |
| ⚠️ Partial | Some evidence collected, gaps remain |
| ❌ Not met | No evidence collected |
| 🔄 In progress | Remediation underway |

## Evidence

**Evidence** is documentation that proves a control is met. It can be:

- **Automated** — pulled from connected integrations (e.g., GitHub access logs)
- **Manual** — uploaded documents (policies, screenshots, reports)
- **AI-generated** — policies and procedures created by Matproof

Evidence has an expiry date. Matproof alerts you when evidence is stale.

## Policies

**Policies** are formal documents that define how your organization operates. Matproof generates AI-drafted policies pre-mapped to your frameworks:

- Acceptable Use Policy
- Information Security Policy
- Incident Response Plan
- Business Continuity Plan
- Data Protection Policy
- Vendor Management Policy

Policies are version-controlled. You can edit them, publish new versions, and track acknowledgements.

## Vendors / Third Parties

In compliance context, **vendors** are organizations that process data or provide ICT services on your behalf. Matproof helps you:

- Maintain an Art. 28 register (GDPR) and TPRM register (DORA)
- Send risk questionnaires and collect responses
- Screen against sanctions lists
- Monitor criticality classifications

## Risk Register

The **risk register** contains identified risks to your organization. Each risk has:

- **Likelihood** and **impact** scores
- **Owner** (accountable person)
- **Treatment** (accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid)
- **Linked controls** — what controls reduce this risk

## CSRD / ESG Data

For CSRD, Matproof introduces the concept of **ESG topics** and **materiality**:

- **Double materiality** — assessing both financial impact on your company AND your company's impact on society/environment
- **ESRS standards** — the EU reporting standards (E1-E5, S1-S4, G1) that define what to disclose
- **Value chain data** — ESG metrics collected from your supplier base

See the [CSRD module docs](/csrd/overview) for details.
