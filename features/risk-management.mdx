## Overview

Matproof's risk management module helps you identify, document, and track risks — with automatic linkage to the controls designed to mitigate them.

## Risk register

The risk register is your central view of all identified risks.

Each risk includes:
- **Risk ID** — unique identifier
- **Category** — cybersecurity, operational, compliance, financial, etc.
- **Description** — what the risk is
- **Likelihood** — probability (1-5)
- **Impact** — severity (1-5)
- **Inherent risk score** — Likelihood × Impact (before controls)
- **Residual risk score** — risk remaining after controls
- **Owner** — accountable person
- **Treatment** — accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid
- **Controls** — linked controls that reduce this risk
- **Status** — open, in treatment, accepted, closed

## Risk scoring

Matproof uses a 5×5 risk matrix:

```
Impact:  1 (Negligible) → 5 (Critical)
Likelihood: 1 (Rare) → 5 (Almost certain)

Risk score = Likelihood × Impact
  1-5:   Low (green)
  6-12:  Medium (amber)
  13-19: High (red)
  20-25: Critical (dark red)
```

## Risk treatment

For each risk, select a treatment:

| Treatment | When to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Mitigate** | Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact |
| **Accept** | Risk is within tolerance; no action needed |
| **Transfer** | Insurance, contract clauses, outsourcing |
| **Avoid** | Stop the activity that creates the risk |

Accepted risks require documented justification and periodic review.

## Linking risks to controls

When you add a control to a risk, Matproof tracks how effective the control is at reducing the risk score.

Example:
```
Risk: Unauthorized access to production database
  Inherent: Likelihood 4 × Impact 5 = 20 (Critical)

Controls applied:
  ✓ MFA enforced on all accounts
  ✓ Database access requires VPN
  ✓ Access reviewed quarterly

  Residual: Likelihood 2 × Impact 5 = 10 (Medium)
```

## Framework mapping

Risks are automatically linked to relevant framework requirements:

- **ISO 27001 Annex A** — risk treatment maps to controls
- **DORA Art. 5-6** — ICT risk management requirements
- **CSRD ESRS 2** — sustainability risk identification requirement

## Risk assessment export

Export your risk register for:
- Audit evidence (ISO 27001, SOC 2)
- Board reporting
- CSRD IRO documentation
- DORA risk management report

Available in Excel, PDF, or JSON format.
