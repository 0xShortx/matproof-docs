## Overview

Matproof's vendor risk module helps you manage the complete lifecycle of third-party relationships — from onboarding and risk assessment to ongoing monitoring.

## Key features

- **Vendor register** — centralized register of all vendors with risk classification
- **Art. 28 register** — GDPR-compliant data processing agreements register
- **DORA TPRM** — ICT third-party risk management per DORA requirements
- **Risk questionnaires** — send and collect vendor security assessments
- **Sanctions screening** — automated screening against EU/UN/OFAC lists
- **Criticality classification** — DORA-compliant ICT service criticality ratings

## Getting started

### Import vendors

Go to **Vendor Risk → Vendors → Import** and upload a CSV:

```csv
name,category,contact_email,country,contract_value,ict_service
Hetzner Online,Infrastructure,vendor@hetzner.com,DE,50000,yes
AWS,Cloud,vendor@aws.com,US,200000,yes
Calendly,SaaS,vendor@calendly.com,US,5000,no
```

### Classify vendors

For each vendor, set:
- **Category** (ICT, professional services, goods, etc.)
- **Criticality** (critical, important, standard) — required for DORA
- **Data processing** (yes/no) — triggers Art. 28 DPA requirement

### Send risk questionnaires

Matproof includes pre-built questionnaire templates:
- DORA ICT third-party assessment
- ISO 27001 vendor security questionnaire
- GDPR data processor assessment
- General vendor risk questionnaire

Vendors respond via secure portal — no account needed.

## Art. 28 Register

The Art. 28 register tracks all vendors who process personal data on your behalf.

For each entry:
- Vendor name and contact
- Categories of personal data processed
- Purpose of processing
- Data transfer mechanisms (for non-EU vendors)
- DPA status (signed / pending / not required)

Export as PDF or Excel for your Data Protection Officer or auditors.

## DORA Compliance

For ICT service providers, Matproof tracks DORA-specific requirements:

- **Criticality classification** per EBA guidelines
- **Contractual requirements** checklist (per DORA Art. 30)
- **Exit strategies** documentation
- **Concentration risk** analysis (dependency on single providers)
- **Sub-processor** tracking

## Sanctions screening

Matproof screens all vendors against:
- EU Consolidated Sanctions List
- UN Security Council Sanctions
- OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN)
- UK Financial Sanctions

Screening runs automatically on import and monthly thereafter. Alerts trigger if a vendor appears on any list.
