## Generating policies

1. Go to **Policies** → **Generate**
2. Matproof creates a draft based on your company information and selected frameworks
3. Review each policy in the editor
4. Customize where needed
5. Publish — policies are now linked to relevant controls as evidence

## Policy editor

The editor supports:
- Rich text formatting
- Version history
- Comments and review workflow
- Bilingual editing (toggle between DE and EN)
- AI-assisted drafting (click to expand a section with AI suggestions)

## Publishing and acknowledgements

When you publish a policy:
- All team members with the relevant role are notified
- They can acknowledge reading the policy in the platform
- Acknowledgement rate is tracked and available as evidence

<Note>
  Some frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001) require documented evidence of employee awareness. Matproof's acknowledgement tracking serves as this evidence.
</Note>

## Version control

Matproof keeps a full version history of every policy. When you update a policy:
- Previous version is archived (never deleted)
- Change log entry is created automatically
- Affected team members are notified of the update
- Re-acknowledgement can be required

This audit trail is required by ISO 27001 and SOC 2.
