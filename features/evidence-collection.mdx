## Overview

Evidence proves that your controls are implemented and working. Matproof collects evidence automatically from connected tools and lets you upload manual evidence when needed.

## Automated evidence

Connect your existing tools to collect evidence automatically:

| Tool | Evidence collected |
|------|-------------------|
| GitHub | Code review requirements, branch protection, access logs |
| Google Workspace | User access lists, MFA status, admin audit logs |
| Jira | Incident tickets, change records, approval workflows |
| AWS | IAM configurations, encryption settings, access logs |
| Azure AD | User provisioning, access reviews, MFA enforcement |
| Slack | (Coming soon) Communication audit logs |

### Connecting integrations

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Click **Connect** next to your tool
3. Authorize via OAuth or API key
4. Matproof begins collecting evidence immediately

Evidence is collected on a configurable schedule (daily by default).

## Manual evidence

For controls that can't be automated, upload evidence manually:

- Go to **Controls** → select a control → **Add evidence**
- Upload PDF, image, CSV, or any file type
- Add a description and expiry date
- Assign to the relevant control

## Evidence expiry

All evidence has an **expiry date**. Matproof sends alerts 30 days before evidence expires so you can collect fresh evidence before it becomes stale.

Default expiry periods:
- Access reviews: 6 months
- Penetration test reports: 12 months
- Policy acknowledgements: 12 months
- Security training: 12 months
- Vendor assessments: 12 months

You can customize expiry periods per control.

## Bulk evidence upload

For initial setup or annual evidence refreshes, use bulk upload:

1. Go to **Evidence → Bulk upload**
2. Download the evidence mapping template
3. Fill in evidence files and their control mappings
4. Upload the ZIP file

Matproof automatically maps evidence to the correct controls.
