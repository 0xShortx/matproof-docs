description: "End-to-end ESG data collection from your supplier base for CSRD reporting."

This page provides a feature overview. For full documentation, see the [CSRD module section](/csrd/overview).

## What it does

The CSRD supply chain module automates the most time-consuming part of CSRD reporting: **collecting ESG data from your suppliers**.

Without automation, this requires:
- Manually emailing hundreds of suppliers
- Following up repeatedly
- Manually entering responses into spreadsheets
- Calculating Scope 3 emissions by hand

Matproof replaces all of this with an automated workflow.
