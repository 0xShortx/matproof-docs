## Supported frameworks

Matproof supports the following compliance frameworks out of the box:

| Framework | Region | Key audience |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **DORA** | EU | Financial institutions, ICT providers |
| **ISO 27001:2022** | Global | Any organization |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | US/Global | SaaS companies, service providers |
| **NIS2** | EU | Operators of essential/important services |
| **GDPR** | EU/EEA | Any org processing EU personal data |
| **CSRD/ESRS** | EU | Large companies, listed SMEs |
| **BaFin BAIT/ZAIT** | Germany | German banks, insurance companies |

## Cross-framework mapping

Matproof automatically maps controls across frameworks. When you collect evidence for one framework, it often satisfies requirements in others:

```
Example:
MFA policy → satisfies:
  - ISO 27001 A.8.5 (Secure authentication)
  - SOC 2 CC6.1 (Logical access controls)
  - DORA Art. 9 (ICT security controls)
  - NIS2 Art. 21 (Authentication measures)
```

This reduces duplication significantly — especially for organizations pursuing multiple certifications simultaneously.

## Adding a framework

1. Go to **Frameworks** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add framework**
3. Select your framework and scope
4. Matproof runs a gap assessment against your existing evidence

## Framework structure

Each framework is broken down into:

```
Framework
  └── Category (e.g., "Access Control")
        └── Control (e.g., "Implement MFA")
              ├── Description
              ├── Guidance
              ├── Evidence requirements
              └── Status (Met / Partial / Not met)
```

## Readiness score

Each framework shows a **readiness score** — the percentage of controls with sufficient evidence. This gives you a quick view of audit readiness.

<Tip>
  Use the readiness score as a leading indicator. Aim for >90% before scheduling an audit.

## Audit export

When you're ready for an audit, export a complete **evidence package**:
- Control list with status
- Evidence documents
- Policy versions
- Risk register
- Vendor register

Exported as a ZIP with folder structure matching the framework's control categories.
